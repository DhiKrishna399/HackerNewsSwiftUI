# HackerNewsSwiftUI
A first attempt at testing out the new SwiftUI framework! This app presents a simple list view with article names and upvotes from the HackerNews API. 
Users can view different articles and instantly view them by using a WebView. 
I also implemented the Observer and MVC design patterns.
